                <p><i>Thursday 8th September 2016</i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">The first task was to create a blank HTML file called 'index', containing the basic structure that makes up a website, i.e <code>&lthtml&gt, &lthead&gt, &ltbody&gt</code> tags.
                    The html tag tells us what language we are going to program in, then below that the head tag will contain any links or scripts needed for the page. The body tag will contain all the elements
                    needed to make up the webpage.  The next step was to add in a header, an introduction paragraph, a table of contents and a hyperlink to the W3schools website. The header is inserted using a
                    <code>&lth&gt</code> tag, followed by a number between 1 & 7 (determines the size of the header with 1 being the largest). The paragraph was inserted by using the <code>&ltp&gt</code> tag,
                    telling the computer that we want to insert a paragraph.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">The table is a bit more than just one tag as we need to tell the computer when to insert rows, column etc. It starts with a <code>&lttable&gt</code> opening tag, followed by a
                    <code>&lttr&gt</code>, telling us that we want to insert a row. Inside that tag, we use a series of <code>&lttd&gt</code> tags, which will determine how many columns we want. As the very first
                    row in a table is usually a header, we can use <code>&ltth&gt</code> instead of <code>&lttd&gt</code> for the first row which will automatically format the first row into a header. To add in
                    a hyperlink for w3schools, I decided to hyperlink a picture of the w3schools logo in the footer. To do this, I used an anchor tag with the link in ‘href’, i.e. <code>&lta href=“##”&gt</code>,
                    followed by the image before the ‘a’ tag was closed off. I then created an external css file, meaning that I could format the elements created, changing the font, size, colour and position. to
                    format the colour in CSS, we simply use <code>colour: ##;</code> followed by the colour in hexadecimal or predetermined colours. To change the size of something, for example, my jumbotron, we
                    can use <code>height: ##;</code> and <code>width: ##;</code> which allows us to specify the exact width and height in pixels, percentages, em or rem. The different sizing options will suit
                    whether or not you prefer a fixed or fluid layout. The table and introduction paragraph we now want to be fluid layout. We do this by changing their size properties to percentages, and setting
                    position to absolute.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Two audio files, one .mp3 and the other .ogg, were created by taking my audio recording and converting them into both audio formats on www.media.io. The next stage is to
                    insert the audio and controls by using <code>&ltaudio controls&gt</code>, which will display a default media player. The final element inserted was an API, more specifically a local web storage. I did
                    this by creating a script, then using an if statement to determine if the computer is capable of storing data. If so, I used <code>localStorage.setItem</code> to set the user, title, date and content of
                    the log. Once they are stored, we need to retrieve them and display it to the screen. To retrieve, we use <code>document.getElementById(“##”).innerHTML = localStorage.getItem(“##”)</code>, where the
                    getElementById will search for that id within the html code, and input the content we insert into <code>.getItem()</code>. In my website, I inserted a <code>&ltdiv&gt</code> with an <code>id=“result”</code>
                    to display the stored content.</p>
                <!-- display log through local storage --

                <p><i>Tuesday 13th September 2016 </i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">The task this week consisted of applying CSS styles and transitions to the project website. The first part we did was applying a CSS font to
                    the body by using <code>font-family: ##;</code>, as well as using google fonts to include a wider range of fonts. I then moved onto putting a few text
                    effects, such as bold or italic. I wanted to make the text in a row appear bold when hovered over, so in css I used <code>font-weight: 500;</code> in a
                    class <code>.table-striped tr:hover {}</code>. In font-weight you can just type bold, but if you want specific weight to it, you can choose from 100-900.
                    The next part was to add a background colour to an element. I decided to change the background colour of the navbar simply by using the
                    <code>background-color: ##;</code> attribute, along with the colour in hexidecimal format.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">To add a border onto an HTML element, we use <code>border-style: ##;</code> and use preferences like dashed or solid, go give your border a specific look.
                    I then added rounded corners onto the border using <code>border-radius: #px;</code> attribute, which will take the number value and apply it as a radius on
                    each corner so the higher the number, the more round it will become. I applied this to a line of text at the bottom of my feedback page to give it
                    a more emphatic effect. On the home page, I have an ISArc logo displayed in the center. I then put a hover property on it, meaning that when a mouse
                    is hovering over it, I can change the effects of it. I have the image currently at 70% width and height but have added in a transition for the hover
                    by adding <code>:hover</code> on the end of the id, and using the <code>transform:scale(1.1,1.1);</code> attribute, it now enlarges by 10% when a user hovers on it. In the
                    css for the image (not hover), the transition is set to 0.5s, meaning that it takes 0.5s to carry out the transition. For added effect, I decided to
                    add in an opacity attribute to the hover element <code>opacity: 0.8;</code>, so that it will go to 80% opacity when hovered. Overall, it adds a nice visual effect
                    to the logo. The navbar at the top of every page is made up of an unordered list, with each <code>&ltli&gt</code> as a button. I did this by first opening a <code>&ltul&gt</code>
                    tag, which tells us we want an unordered list, then inside the tag, we use a series of <code>&ltli&gt</code> tags, which act as each point in the list.</p>

                <p><i>Wednesday 14th September 2016 </i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">Today, we were introduced to using a GUI editor, using the W3 validator and creating a
                    repository in GitHub. For the GUI editor we used BlueGriffon, which allowed us to format text and other elements without writing
                    the code. We also practiced inserting HTML tables using the editor, for example, using it for a footer, and changing the tables fill,
                    size etc. We were then introduced to the W3 validator website, which allows you to input your source code of your website and it will
                    check it for errors or bad programming practice. Using this, I was able to identify errors and other obsolete elements and attributes.
                    The final part in todays task was to set up a repository on GitHub and to upload our websites. This is performed using terminal with git
                    commands, and has allowed for the website to be available to the public eye.

                <h4 class="media-heading">#004 Internet Architecture</h4>
                <p><i>Tuesday 20th September 2016 </i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">This unit is based around the Internet architecture and the various types of networks, bandwidths,
                    protocols etc. that is needed to connect a client to the internet. A client server network is designed to allow the client access to
                    resources from a central computer, i.e a server. The main purpose of this is that it acts as a hub for a number of less powerful computers.
                    The hardware and software that a client needs to successfully connect to the internet is a PC or a device connected to a network card or modem,
                    which will be connected to a router that sends and receives the data packets, and a suitable browser on the device so that it can interpret the
                    data using protocols and display it to the screen.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">The data is transmitted from the client to the server can vary in speed, in both upload and download times. This is relative to the bandwidth,
                    which is the amount of data that can be transmitted at any given time (usually measured per second). The three types of bandwidth that we looked
                    at was PSTN, ISDN and DSL. PSTN or Public Switched Telephone Network is basically the world’s circuit-switched telephone networks, sometimes referred
                    to as the Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS). ISDN or Integrated Services Digital Network is used for sending voice, video and data over digital or normal
                    telephone lines, which supports transfer rates of around 64 Kbps/s. DSL or Digital Subscriber Line was created to allow high bandwidth transfer rates across
                    all homes and businesses using just normal telephone lines. The speed can range anywhere from 256kbit/s to over 100Mbit/s.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">When data is transferred from server to the client, it will be just raw data which would be meaningless without protocols. There are various different types
                    of Protocol, such as TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP or POP3, which are made up of rules so that computers can interpret and read data. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
                    is the process of breaking up information that has been sent into smaller pieces, called data packets. These packets are then sent and put back together in the
                    correct order. Internet Protocol (IP) is linked with TCP as it is the final stage in taking the data packets and directing them to the required destination, using
                    an IP address which will be unique to every computer. Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP is most commonly known for being the protocol used for the World Wide
                    Web. It is the process of using TCP/IP to transfer HTML, so that when a URL is entered into a browser, it will fetch and display the webpage. Simple Mail Transfer
                    Protocol (SMTP) and Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) are used for the sending and receiving of electronic mail. SMTP is used mainly in the sending of emails,
                    whereas POP3 is used along side to receive emails, as SMTP has a limited ability to queue incoming messages. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">There is a process of how the internet works, and how we receive data transmissions. It begins with a PC or device that is linked to a router. If, for example,
                    the client enters a URL into a browser, it will send a request to the closest Point of Presence, which is run by your Internet service provider. It will then send
                    back the necessary data back to the router/modem. If, however, you require information from another country or ISP, it will then find the closest Internet Exchange
                    Point (IXP), which will cover several thousand POP’s. It is then sent back to the POP, then back to the client. This process can result in longer loading times, but
                    in reality, is a very efficient way of networks to exchange information, as well as reducing costs.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">When a user has entered a domain to take them to a website, the IP address needs to be located. This is where Domain Name Systems (DNS) comes into play as it acts
                    as an address book for IP’s, making it an essential component of the internet. The way that an IP address will be located is by the naming structure, i.e, the prefix
                    (http) tells us that we want to use the Hypertext transfer protocol and that we are communicating with the World Wide web. The subdomain (www.) also tells us that we
                    are searching the WWW. The domain name is the next part (example.com), which is the website unique identifier, as no two websites will have the same domain. The last
                    part of the domain name (.com) is called the extension, which tells us what type of website is being run, e.g. .com, .org and .net are all top level domain names with
                    unrestricted open domains, whereas .co.uk or .org.uk are secondary level domains (.uk being the secondary level) with open access.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">For companies that want to have multiple websites under the same server, there is shared domains, allowing a more economical approach to hosting multiple websites. Shared
                    domains will use a different subdomain with the original domain, for example, Google will have www.google.com, maps.google.com, mail.google.com etc. for each of their
                    different sites. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">The rate in which technology is developing and growing into our day-to-day lives is quite rapid compared to 15 years ago. Due to its importance, we would be almost lost
                    without it. A more recent development in remote servers is the cloud, which basically allows users/businesses to store, manage and process data onto external servers
                    rather than locally, meaning that we can access it anywhere (as long as theres an internet connection). Cloud computing has proved to be beneficial in providing better
                    disaster recovery, increased collaboration between users and more environmentally friendly. However, cloud computing does have particular drawbacks, with the main one
                    being that internet access is always required to retrieve from the cloud, meaning that if the internet went down, no-one can access their files. Another major issue is
                    security, as if it is a shared cloud in a businesses for example, it could be easy for the wrong person to get access, or malicious software attacks would be targeted
                    more toward the cloud. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">Really Simple Syndication or RSS is a technology that allows you to keep track of updates on websites using a standardised XML format, then shown in an aggregator (reader).
                    RSS feeds allows you to have complete control over what you receive without even entering an email address, meaning no spam, viruses, phishing etc. However, Atom, which is
                    an alternative to RSS was created to address some of the flaws it had, such as differentiating between relative and non-relative URL’s, providing each entry with a globally
                    unique ID, and creating “autodiscovery”, which allows feed aggregators to automatically detect if there is a feed.</p>

                <p><i>Wednesday 21st September 2016 </i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">Currently, there is very little legislation that surrounds internet communication. The Malicious Communications Act 1988 was the first
                    Act that was passed for the internet, which states that it is an offence to send a communication with the intention of distress or anxiety. However, this law was passed
                    before the introduction of any kind of social media like Facebook or Twitter, or before the vast growth in the technological age. This means that it has to be interpreted to
                    include tweets or text messages etc. or to apply to any modern day communication. Ethical conduct online has surpassed our legislation, in that most people will know what is
                    appropriate/inappropriate communication, but it has no legal backing.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">For employees in a distributed workplace will need various different ways to communicate efficiently, depending on the situation. Common technologies that are used for this
                    include Voice over IP (VoIP), which will connect a landline number to a mobile using the internet. VoIP tends to be useful for employees who tend to travel, but can just link
                    their office phone to their mobile to avoid numerous calls. For people who don’t use VoIP, some use conversation voice to text, which will take an incoming message, converts
                    it into text then sends it over via text message to the recipient. Presencing, which allows a server to locate where you are at all times by logging onto the internet, can be
                    useful for employers to see how long the travel time is, or to keep track of meetings. One of the most common forms of communication for distributed workplaces is mobile
                    technology, as it vastly opens up accessibility as you can use it almost anywhere. This proves most useful when employees are in some downtime, for example, waiting in the
                    airport, or if they are somewhere without access to computers, meaning productivity will increase.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Social Media, which is tech largest, most popular form of communication for businesses and the general public, has stormed and forever changed the way we market, shop, socialise
                    or promote. However, as there are many different forms of social media which will have their own format for content and marketing. For example, Facebook, being the market leader
                    with over 1.7 billion users worldwide, is popular for promoting almost every kind of business, accompanied with photos/videos or prize draws. Twitter on the other hand, is used
                    for short, concise messages or LinkedIn acts as an online CV to help people develop their professional careers ad create useful links to employers. Other forms of social media
                    include Pinterest, Youtube, Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp or Reddit. Each of these all have different formats, each having their own individual strengths and target markets.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Web 2.0 refers to the new generation of how we use and design websites, moving from static web pages to dynamic or user-generated content, allowing for the incorporation of social
                    networking sites, blogs, wikis, folksonomies or video sharing. Rich internet applications or RIA was a major breakthrough in internet design, aiming to deliver the same visual
                    aspects and characteristics of desktop application sofware with the introduction of CSS transitions, JavaScript and browser plug-ins. Another major step in Web 2.0 is the Social
                    Web, allowing individual to create their own unique profiles and to have their information to be shared publicly or privately. Mashups, which is an integration of two or more
                    elements to create one product, for example, using someones profile information and Google maps to display where those people are located. Blogs and RSS feeds were also a new
                    innovation to the web, allowing people to view and input regular updates. Blogs have a basic structure of a title, author, content and categories, which can then be linked to RSS
                    feeds. RSS differs from a blog, as it will run through an aggregator (reader) that acts as a ‘news feed’ , giving you updates on websites without any clutter or advertisements.
                    Folksonomies are a new form of public tagging onto online items to help you locate or collate content, for example, the most famous form would be the use of hashtags in the likes
                    of Instagram, where you can view all posts related to the particular tag. The tags are user generated, meaning that there is no limit to what you tag.</p>

                <p><i>Tuesday 27th September 2016 </i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">As we are living through a rapidly growing technological age, we have become reliant, and keep a significant amount of sensitive information
                    digitally. This has directly affected the amount of software attacks from people who are trying to gain access to this information, or delete files from a server. This is why we must
                    protect ourselves against such attacks. Simple ways to help prevent against attacks to your PC or server include keeping your PC’s and antivirus up to date, staying aware of network
                    speed and connectivity, as if it drops or becomes slow it can be due to an attack. For servers, any network ports that aren’t being used should be closed. If an attack were to happen,
                    the first step would be to work out what type of attack, and where its coming from (IP address). If the attack was internal, any devices/PC’s the are affected by the attack should be
                    disconnected, or if it came from outside the network, the IP address should be blocked. Any information/files that are sensitive should be backed up immediately, along with the logs of
                    how the attack happened so it can be prevented against in future. The final step would be to completely reinstall the OS on the affected computers, ensuring that the malware is gone.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">However, cyberattacks aren’t the only way that data can be compromised. Another form of attack is social engineering which refers to people purposely tricking someone into giving them
                    sensitive personal details that aren’t available for public viewing. For example, if you were contacted by phone, with someone confirming a few public details (such as name, address etc.)
                    to reel you in, then asking you to confirm a few private details. This form of social engineering is still common, but also exists in fake emails or phishing websites. To help prevent
                    against this, you should always ask the unknown person to confirm who they are and where they’re calling from. Another common form of social engineering is phishing sites, which usually
                    come in the form of an email sent from what appears to be a legitimate business, asking you to provide verification that would then redirect you to a duplicate website to enter your details.
                    It can be more difficult to identify phishing sites, so checking your anti-virus software or security logs for any unsolicited activity, or if you are unsure of the legitimacy of the
                    call/site, its always useful to research into it.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">To further protect your data, encryption will often be used. The way encryption works is by using an algorithm to cypher the data, so that if someone were to gain access, it would be
                    meaningless without an encryption key (used to decipher the encryption). There are two main types of encryption: Symmetric and Asymmetric. Symmetric encryption involves just one key,
                    used for both cyphering and deciphering, which poses a security issue, as if someone were to intercept and gain the key, they decrypt the data. This is where Asymmetric encryption has the
                    advantage, as there is a public and a private key in that one key will encrypt the information, whereas the other will decrypt and vice versa. So if the same situation were to occur and
                    someone intercepted the data, they would not be able to decrypt without access to the private key.</p>
                <p>The next topic we looked at was Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) which is basically a way in which which the general public can authenticate an entity without sharing any personal details with
                    the website that has requested the authenticity check. The first step is for the entity to request a certificate from the Registration Authority (RA), who will then check the persons details
                    (such as identity or payment methods), and if successful, will then send a request to the Certification Authority (CA). The  CA will then send the certificate back to the entity, but will also
                    send the information to the Validation Authority (VA). The purpose of the VA is so that a website can send them the public key (sent by the entity) to confirm their authenticity. However, with
                    having a chain of trust in PKI, there is a liability in that if there was any security issue or if the CA was compromised, the whole PKI is at risk. This happened in 2011, where any
                    certificates given out by Dutch CA DigiNotar were forced to blacklist after there was a number of fake certificates discovered.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Most large companies that are involved with IT and modern technologies will provide their employees with company devices, such as computers or phones, so that they can be easily monitored and
                    controlled. However, some companies will implement a Bring your own device (BYOD) policy, which allows employees to bring their own devices to work, and are permitted to use them for company
                    information and applications. The policy both benefits the company and the employee, as it would save a great deal of costs for the company, but also gives employees better enjoyment of using
                    their own personal device. There are requirements for BYOD, as working with privileged information can be risky with an unknown device. The first requirement is a software application that can
                    manage all the devices on the network, but also ensuring that no device is being misused or unsecured. This is where the second requirement comes in, which is a written policy for both, the
                    employer and employee, outlining their responsibilities, safety and misuse. They will be required to then sign an agreement stating that they have read and understood the policy.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">For companies that will have several devices on a network, it can become difficult in making sure that they are all up-to-date and running the same settings. MDM or Mobile Device Management
                    refers to managing and configuring multiple devices across a network, for example, Apple Configurator, which easily allows you to prepare, deploy and supervise iOS devices. MDM proves to be
                    useful for monitoring a device’s life cycle, ensuring that the devices are getting full, efficient use. The life cycle consists of five main stages: Provisioning, Using, Maintaining,
                    Monitoring and Decommissioning. The provisioning stage of the life cycle refers to setting up the device with software, access requirements and networks. The next stage is Using, which is
                    deploying the devices to the users. After a certain amount of time of usage, lets say a year or example, the devices would need security or software updates applied across all the devices,
                    which comes under the Maintaining stage. The Monitoring stage refers to the MDM taking usage data, such as when its used or what its used for, or, for example, in a company that would have
                    delivery systems, the devices could be used for GPS to keep track of where they are or the duration of the journey. And finally, decommissioning, so when the devices are at the end of their
                    life cycle, i.e. become outdated or obsolete, they will be wiped and taken apart/recycled.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">In more recent years, cloud-based services are being used more and more throughout our homes and in businesses. it offers many benefits as opposed to locally storing your data, and provides an
                    almost untouchable back if any of the local computers/servers were damaged. However, this service does pose security threats. As cloud servers hold a vast amount of sensitive data, such as financial
                    info, intellectual property, trade secrets etc. they effectively become a prime target for hackers. This consequently leads onto another threat of permanent data loss, as malicious hackers have been
                    known to hack into cloud data centres and permanently delete data to harm businesses or even as extreme as economic damage. DOS or denial-of-service attacks can often occur against cloud services,
                    which basically means that they are overloading the processing power, ultimately crashing the system. However, some of these attacks can often come from inside the cloud service, i.e. a former
                    employee, system administrator or business partner that would target their former workplace as revenge or just having a malicious agenda. There are many other security threats against cloud-based
                    services, such as account hijacking, hacked API’s or system vulnerabilities bu</p>
                <p class="logEdit">In the unlikely event of a natural disaster, or if the cloud has been hacked, there would need to be a recovery plan to ensure that the data is protected and that it is still available to the public.
                    There are online web services that can monitor and alert you of any downtime, i.e it will ping every 5 seconds (or any given amount of time) to ensure that the cloud is still up and running, so if it
                    goes down, it will send a notification to the user. As the cloud is reliant upon an internet connection, problems and panic will occur if the connection goes down. This is where a backup connection
                    can become useful to switch to, or a redundant connection that will kick in if another fails. If the cloud service was to completely shut down in the event of a natural disaster, it is always useful
                    to have an onsite backup, and to periodically create the backups to ensure that minimal data is lost. Many would argue that this defeats the purpose of the cloud, but it is a safe option to have onsite
                    backups. Companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) use zones in the case of a natural disaster, in that if, for example, an earthquake occurs and a zone goes down, it will switch to one of their other
                    zones to ensure that users can still access their information.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Continuous Data Protection or CDP would be a necessity amongst businesses, but depending on the business will depict the best technique to use. For any non-critical data within a network, these can be
                    backed up daily, or every few days. If the non critical data were to be backed up continuously with the critical data, it would result in inefficient waste of processing power. For more critical data,
                    they can be backed up continuously, or even transactionally, i.e. anytime a file is changed, it will be immediately updated or if a file is deleted, it can be recovered straight away from the previous
                    backup. This type of backup can be useful when it comes to transactions or for dropbox where files are exchanged.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Most of us have probably experienced the frustration of a lost internet connection, especially when we cannot seem to fix it. If so, there are a few steps you can take to work out exactly where the problem
                    lies. The first setting that should be checked is to see if TCP/IP is enabled (settings > network > advanced > TCP/IP). If so, you should then check if an IP address has been assigned to the computer which
                    should be under the TCP/IP settings. Below the IP address, the router should be checked, in that if there is no IP address under the router, this means that the computer cannot ping the router. In the same
                    settings menu, you should check if the computer can contact a DHCP service under ‘Configure IPv4’. If everything there is operational, using terminal you can check if the computer can perform a DNS lookup
                    using ‘dig example.com’. However, sometimes the problem is beyond our control, as it could be server-side rather than client-side. Server-side basically means that the problem doesn’t lie with your computer,
                    but with the server you’re trying to interact with. This can be identifiable usually by an error message from the server/browser, or if you can access other services on the same device. If the issue is
                    client-side, the easiest way to check is to try access the service under another device or computer, so if it is accessible on other devices, the computer contains the problem.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Keeping your PC clean and not having any excess files/programs can dramatically affect performance (depending on how much), lifespan and reduces the risk of any computer system failures. Simple ways to maintain
                    your computer include performing a disk cleanup and defragmentation, removing any temporary and cached files, cleaning dust from the fan and keeping all the system and security software up to date.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">The motherboard of a computer is used for connecting many of the crucial electronic components, such as the CPU or memory, and is printed on a PCB. Storage devices are used to store all the data within a device
                    and an optical disc, such as CD’s or DVD’s are used for storing, installing and backing up data on your computer.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">To establish a basic level of security on a PC, we use authentication, which confirms the identity of a user/computer using a set of principles. There are four basic principles that lie
                    within authentication, with each one containing different forms of security. Basic forms of authentication that exist in most systems would be passwords, security questions or security keys, which fall
                    under the Establishing an Identity principle. This would always be the first step in authentication, as if someone cannot confirm an identity, no further access should be granted. Once the identity is
                    confirmed, establishing access, or checking what the user has access to should then be checked. In many systems, different users will be assigned different roles, each having their own level of access.
                    Different levels of access can determine what information the user has access to, or what actions they can perform. Any of these steps however, will not be secured without the third principle of
                    establishing a secure connection. To ensure that the connection is secure, encryption/decryption is used, with more complex encryption algorithms being more secure. The fourth and final principle is
                    periodic, in that the user may be time bound which sets a time limit, session based which will allocate a user with a session ID after verifying credentials, or request based. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">The purpose of Remote access protocols are to control the establishment of connections and the transmission of data over WAN links. Some common protocols include Point-to-Point or PPP,
                    which creates dial-up connections between a client and a server or ISP; Internet Protocol Security or IPsec which can be used as a remote access tunnelling protocol to encrypt traffic going over the
                    internet; Point-to-Point tunnelling protocol (PPTP), which is another tunnelling protocol used with VPNs.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">If your connection has dropped and you need to troubleshoot the cable and ADSL modem, follow these few steps to ensure it is done successfully. The first step should be to power-cycle
                    the DSL modem by turning it off and unplugging it for around 30 seconds, then plug it back in and turn it on. Once this is completed, your computer should be rebooted. On the modem, there should be a
                    DSL sync light on, which means its connected to the internet. On the computer, the TCP/IP settings should the be checked, along with the LAN light. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">There are a number of ways to diagnose Booting problems with your PC, which can often be overlooked leading to the presumption that the computer is broken. Ways to identify booting
                    problems include: nothing showing on the display, but the display works on another computer; the fans or hard drive is spinning up, but still nothing on the display; the bios screen is displaying or
                    if you hear the bios beeps, which all have different codes for different errors. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">Disk partitioning is the separation of one hard drive into multiple independent partitions, which can be individually formatted to perform different  tasks. The reason that partitioning
                    is important is that it creates a logical space that the OS can address, as well as reducing the risk of any boot problems, e.g. if you keep your data, applications and OS on the same partition and if
                    something happens to the index file, the computer won’t be able to boot up the hard drive or access any of the data. A Network File System or NFS is an application that allows a user to store, update
                    and view files on a network as if it were on the user’s own computer. </p>

                <h4 class="media-heading">#007 Principles of Internet Security</h4>
                <p><i>Wednesday 28th September 2016 </i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">There are three major types of encryption, that many people will have probably seen before using Wi-Fi, which are Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and Wi-Fi Protected Access 2
                    (WPA2). WEP was one of the first types of security algorithms introduced to 802.11 standard, using a 64-bit key which would be entered as a string of 10 hexadecimal characters, or a 128-bit key for a
                    string of 26 hexadecimal characters. WEP in modern day age would be a less secure option as opposed newer, more complex algorithms. WPA was the replacement for WEP, which generates a new 128-bit key for
                    each data packet, meaning that it prevents against the type of attacks that WEP was susceptible to. Following on from WPA was WPA2 (802.11i standard), which provides much more secure data protection by
                    implementing FIPS 140-2 AES encryption algorithm, providing government grade security.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Web security is probably the most vital aspect to modern technology, as there is always going to me malicious attackers, whose aim is to steal or destroy sensitive data. Different forms of web security exist,
                    each making it a bit safer from such attackers. Authentication, which is the process of determining if someone/something is what they claim, thus providing access if authenticated. It gives better control
                    over the users in a system and provides an extra layer of protection. Digital certificates, issued from the Registration Authority (RA), is basically an electronic ID for a person, computer or organisation
                    using the public key infrastructure (PKI). Encryption, being one of the original forms of web security, is the translation of data into a secret code, but only being able to read the code with an encryption
                    key. The two main types of encryption is symmetric and asymmetric or public key encryption. A Firewall is a network security system that monitors incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security
                    rules, thus stopping illegitimate access from the web.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Encryption helps enforce three main premises of security: confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation. With confidentiality, it keeps prying eyes off sensitive data by using encryption keys, meaning that
                    only the intended recipient will be able to decrypt. For example, there is only two people in the world that know the recipe for coco-cola, meaning that it is highly confidential. This is the same premise as
                    encryption in that only the intended people should have access to it. Integrity refers to making sure that the data sent is complete and untampered with by using a hash that corresponds to the data being sent.
                    In effect, if the data was changed it would not decrypt properly. Non-repudiation, which is the assurance that someone cannot deny the authenticity of their signature or a message that was sent, is enforced
                    with encryption as it corresponds the encryption key to the sender using the senders information.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">A computer virus, much like a biological virus, is designed to infect and replicate to prevent you from functioning normally. They are made to infect your computer programs and files, replicating and spreading
                    to alter how your PC operates or completely corrupting the system. Viruses are most danerous when they are aimed at stealing or destroying sensitive data. Simple ways to help protect against a computer virus
                    include keeping your OS and other anti-virus software up-to-date, preforming daily scans, being cautious of email links and attachments (always scan for viruses no matter the source), using firewalls and strong
                    passwords. There many other ways to help prevent against viruses and should all be taken seriously, as most viruses aren’t noticeable. Viruses can also infect our computers through no fault of our own, i.e if
                    there is a bug or a loophole in the program/OS software. Once they are discovered by the developer or users, they will then usually then fix the problem and release an update with the necessary patches so that
                    the problems will not reoccur.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">As mentioned before, unidentified links or attachments in emails is a common way for a virus to make its ay into your computer, which is why a few simple steps need to be followed to ensure you’re not infected.
                    Even if someone you know personally or trust sends you an email, there could still be viruses attached unknowingly from the sender. The first thing that you should do is to scan the attachment using anti-virus
                    software; it will suss out if it is infected. You should also confirm with the sender if they actually sent an attachment, so if the source is not identified the email and attachment should be deleted. After any
                    encounter with untrusted emails or attachments, a virus scan should be run to make sure that no virus has infected your computer.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">If a malicious attack is suspected against your computer, there are a few steps to follow to prevent against data loss/compromise, and to successfully flush it out. If any sign of an attack is apparent, the computer
                    must be disconnected from the internet and local network so it will avoid any other devices being infected. Anti-virus/malware software must then be run to locate if anything has been affected and then removed.
                    Infected files should then be removed, with any other uninfected data backed up in case the attack reoccurs. Any other devices sharing the same network should then go through the same process to ensure that they
                    haven’t been compromised.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">For many people/businesses, there is a significant amount of sensitive or valuable information stored, meaning that every security precaution should be taken. Some precautions include: enabling a Firewall will
                    control what information flows between your computer and the internet, installing anti-virus and anti-malware software, removing any unnecessary software as intruders tend to attack software vulnerabilities, install
                    intrusion detection software, enabling auto timeout so that accounts will be locked, and most simply, using strong passwords on everything, i.e. include a mix of lower and upper case letters, symbols, numbers etc.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">A computer virus is defined as a piece of code written to alter/damage files or your computers operation without the users permission or knowledge. Viruses will commonly come attached to something, or in the path of
                    execution of another program. A worm, however, is different from a virus in that they will replicate themselves without a host file, and even though they generally come inside a document, it will travel from computer
                    to computer.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Spyware is a type of malware that installs into your computer without any knowledge of the user. The reason anti-malware software is needed is that spyware is generally undetectable but dangerous. Its aim is to collect
                    the users personal information, like key logging, passwords or other sensitive data,  but can also install additional software and take control over a computer without the users knowledge. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">The “Right to be forgotten” is a Data Protection Directive passed in 1995 that allows an individual to ask search engines to remove links with personal information that is inaccurate, inadequate or excessive. However,
                    media websites will be the exception as they have the right to freedom of expression, meaning that if an article was written about someone to that individuals distaste, by law, the article cannot be removed.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">E-security in any company should be taken seriously as it could jeopardise sensitive information, or compromise intellectual property. This is where company encryption will apply, to ensure that all communication and
                    files are properly encrypted. Generally, in most encryption policies will incorporate boot disk, email, external devices, file, folder, mobile device and transport-level encryption to ensure that if any device or files that were
                    targeted, encryption would prevent any information being lost. As well as encryption, general use of any company or personal systems should be appropriate in that no untrusted websites/sources should be visited, no company owned
                    information should be stored on personal devices or copied, accessing systems for any purpose other than conducting business or inducting any malicious programs into the network or server. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">The Copyright Act of 1976 grants exclusive rights to the copyright holder that includes literary works, music, pictorial, graphic, motion pictures and other audiovisual works, architectural works, websites and software
                    programs. If anything was copied and used from the internet, such as pictures or text, is considered copyright infringement and can result in legal action being taken against you. </p>

                <p><i>Tuesday 5th October 2016</i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">This week we began learning javascript to provide some functionality to our websites. But before that, we had a bit of a background look on the language and how it works. Javascript is an object-orientated language
                    meaning that it defines, not only the data type of a data structure, but the types of functions that can be applied. It provides back-end functionality to an HTML document and will run once the browser loads the page and reads
                    the HTML code. An object is basically a collection of properties that make it unique, for example, a car would be the object, with the car name, model, weight, colour etc. being the properties which will differ from car to car.
                    In a program, each property will be assigned with a corresponding method, which will be the same but performed at different times. In my website, the object would be a log, with the properties being the name, title, date and content. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">There are two different types of Javascript: Client-side and server-side. Client-side scripting refers to the side that the browser is running, i.e. when a user loads a web page, the browser will then interpret and
                    run the scripts, e.g. responding to mouse clicks or form navigation whereas server-side scripting is where the web page and other content is stored. It will then send out the web pages to the client upon request. Since the
                    introduction of javascript in 1997, there has been many updates and versions, implementing new features and newer syntax to develop better and more complex applications. The first version of javascript was released in Netscape
                    Navigator 2.0 and was originally called LiveScript. Its intention was to allow web designers to add some interactivity to their websites. Since its initial release, there has been 12 versions of Javascript, along with new
                    frameworks implemented, such as jQuery, AngularJS or Backbone which allows the user to organise and present your code, much like a template. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">When writing any program in any language, it is always useful to use good coding practices as it can make the code much more readable for yourself and others, especially if there is a bug that needs found. Simple
                    practices include putting all declarations at the top, avoiding global variables as they can be overwritten by other scripts, or making good use of comments to divide sections or describe a function. Global variables are declared
                    outside the function, i.e. its relevant to all functions and can be overwritten, however local variables are declared within the function meaning they’re cannot be used outside of that specific function. In Javascript, the symbol
                    for contention and addition is the same (‘+’), and are used differently. Concatenation is used for adding on a string to display, for example if a variable was declared <code>var message = “hello”;</code> , we can display this by concatenating
                    it, e.g. <code>alert(“The user says” + message);</code>, whereas addition is used if we wish to add two numbers together, e.g. <code>var x = 5.7 + 6.3;</code>. </p>

                <p class="logEdit">Debugging Code properly is an important step in locating and fixing bugs, especially if they are syntax or logical errors, as they can be more challenging to locate. In javascript, debugging can be more difficult
                    as if there is an error, the code will just not run without giving any indication of where it is. Simple ways to help debug the code can sometimes prove to be the fastest and most efficient way, for example, using console.log()
                    in certain sections to help pinpoint exactly where its going wrong, or using breakpoints in a similar way to then inspect each individual section.  Once the section is locatedwith the error, you can then go line by line to find
                    the exact error and rectify it. These forms of debugging are referred to as native. The other form of debugging is called supplemental which refers to using other aids, such as your web browser, e.g. when testing on a mobile
                    device you can inspect element on any errors, using 3rd party plugins which there is a various range of, or using online validators, e.g. javascriptlint.com, where you can copy & paste the code to which the website will then
                    display any errors.

                <p class="logEdit">As the internet is the primary source of malicious malware, its important to ensure that both your browser and operating system are up-to-date with anti-virus/malware software/extensions. However, with different
                    types of attacks, the browser and OS will have different duties to protect the computer, i.e. if there is a malicious script from a server, its then the browsers job to identify and block the script from running. If, for example,
                    there was an infected file downloaded onto the machine, the OS would then be in charge of locating and blocking the virus from infecting your computer. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">Javascript has proved to be beneficial for any website to aid in functionality and to collect website data, with approximately 88% of websites currently implementing the language. However, it is also well known for
                    being quite dangerous for a number of reasons, such as cross-site scripting or XSS, which is the process of injecting malicious Javascript code into a website so that if anyone visits the site, it will run the script. XSS can
                    also be used for search engine poisoning, infecting websites that are high up in rankings in search engines. As a result of XSS, it is now seen as the biggest website security issue today, with over 55% of websites liable to XSS
                    injection.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">One of Javascript most used functions by most websites nowadays is cookies, which are designed to store specific information about you to then aid them to give a better user experience, tailoring different parts
                    of the website based on the cookies information. However, these are seen by some as a violation of privacy as the cookie itself will continue to exist after the browser is closed meaning that other companies/users can view the
                    information. To help prevent against any malicious javascript attacks, its good practice to keep an eye out for signed scripts. Signed scripts have a digital signature that then validate the authenticity and security of the
                    script, and also allows the user to assign privileges to it. </p>

                <p><i>Wednesday 2nd November 2016</i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">A Database in computing terms is a collection of data sorted and organised into separate tables allowing it to be easily read and to provide better usability in finding particular data. However, they are then
                    separated into two types; relational and non-relational. Relational databases operate by storing information into different tables with a primary key (unique identifier) and if needed, a foreign key (for relating/linking other
                    tables together), allowing for information to be easily retrieved/correlated and returned to the user. The most popular of these are MySQL, Oracle, or Microsoft SQL, mostly being used in large companies. Non-relational
                    databases however refer to data being stored in an unstructured store i.e. without the table/key model, providing a solution to big data problems. For example, companies such as Google or Facebook have a vast number of
                    applications with millions of users online everyday, so using a relational database would not be able to cope with any traffic spikes.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">In relational databases, there are what’s called relationships which allow us to create a link between tables, for example, if there was a company database with an employees table and jobs table, there would be
                    a link between the two so that if a user wanted to know who was working specific jobs, they would just perform a query. However, the relationships are then divided into three main types; One-to-Many, One-to-One and Many-to-Many,
                    each used in different scenarios. One-to-Many is the most common form of relationship which defines as allowing a record in one table to be related to many records in another, e.g. a database holding teacher and pupils’ details
                    would be one-to-many as one teacher can have many pupils. In a One-to-One relationship, only one record can be related to one record from another table and vice versa which occurs when the two related fields are both primary
                    keys or are unique, e.g. a passenger and a passport. Many-to-Many relationships relate to records having many matching records in other tables, and vice versa.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Back when relational databases didn’t exist, it would be very difficult to search through large databases for specific information or groups of records. SQL was a query language designed for relational database
                    management systems that allows a user to update or receive data, with standard SQL commands that provide a global standard of working with databases. Common DBMS that use SQL include Oracle, mySQL, Sybase, Access, Microsoft
                    SQL Server etc.</p>

                <p><i>Thursday 3rd November 2016</i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">Now that computing technology has progressed vastly, with multiple programming languages for different purposes, there has been a number of predefined libraries or plug-ins that’s basically a collection of data,
                    templates and pre-written code that can be called or referenced in a software program. Using these libraries can have a number if implications, but also seen to have benefits to a software developer. Some of the main benefits
                    of using such libraries include the reusability, i.e. one simple piece of code could be used thousands of times by various developers; web caching in that if a user visits your website that have already a copy of the file from
                    the library, it will then subsequently increase the performance of the webpage. However, website plugins tend to be targeted upon by malicious attackers to inject with XSS or other harmful software. In some cases, the plugin
                    will be infected directly or it could be referencing code that has been infected. Another drawback that comes with predefined libraries and plugins is that they will depreciate quickly due to a lack of support, meaning they
                    can become outdated/obsolete or liable to security threats.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Libraries are easy to implement into a program/website. To do this the first step is to locate the library’s source file, either by downloading and saving the file into your project, or via URL. The library then
                    needs to be referenced in the head of the webpage using <code>&ltlink&gt</code> tag, meaning that the user can now call a particular method/event and input custom parameters/values. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">The XMLHttpRequest object interacts with XML by initially sending a request in XML, then using the responseXML method so that Javascript can then interpret and parse the XML into the data that was being fetched.
                    Overall, it allows the user to request data from a server and return to the client without having to refresh the page, i.e. it allows the page to automatically update without disturbing what the user is doing. XMLHttpRequest
                    is an object thats included in AJAX-based requests. AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript And XML, and allows a developer to request/receive data from a server in the background by combining the XMLHttpRequest object and
                    Javascript/HTML DOM to display the fetched data. The process in which AJAX works is first, an event occurring (page loaded or button), then creating and sending the request object from the browser to the server. The server
                    will process the request and sends a response back to the browser, where the browser will then read the response using Javascript and update the page content. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">However, using AJAX-based requests is not the only way to fetch and receive data in the background. Some alternatives to AJAX include XUL or XML User Interface Language which was developed by Mozilla that allows
                    applications to run, even when not connected to the internet, Java Applets that allows the attachment of Java Programs into an HTML page to perform similar tasks to Ajax, or Ruby on Rails which is an object orientated language
                    used for database-driven applications. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">XML, much like any other languages, has a structure and restrictions that must be followed to successfully run. When performing an Ajax request, the XML response must be parsed in Javascript so it can be
                    interpreted but to do this the XML document must be declared with the MIME type set as ‘text/xml’ and should follow the basic tag structure. XML responses are also limited to a particular size of 2,147,483,647 characters which
                    is disadvantaged compared to JSON that has no response limit. </p>

                <p><i>Tuesday 8th November 2016</i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">Uniform Resource Identifier or URI refers to the identity of a particular resource, containing two subsidaries: URL’s and URN’s. For anyone who has used a web browser will be familiar with a URL (Uniform Resource
                    Locator) which is what we see at the top of a website, i.e. it is the location of the website containing the websites domain name <code>(URL: http://www.google.co.uk/)</code>, whereas a URN or Uniform Resource Name is used to identify the
                    resource, e.g. a URN would typically take this format <code>’urn:oasis:names:docbook:dtd:xml:4.1.2’</code>. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">Many websites nowadays are now pestered with adverts or popup ads that can be a pain. Now however, there are a number of simple ways to block such adverts and some ways don’t require any additional downloads.
                    There are some browsers that come with a built in ad blocker, such as Opera which can be downloaded on windows or OS, but some do not which is why there are now 3rd party plugins which block any incoming adverts that cause any
                    annoyance, e.g. Adblocker being the most popular plugin. If however, you are experiencing ads not only on your browser but other applications, there is ad-blocking software that can be downloaded and installed onto your OS that
                    block ads regardless of which program its on, e.g. AdFender which works independently from web browsers.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Many websites now make use of various encryption methods for users if they are, for example, entering private details so that no outside malicious attacker can gain access to the information. One of the encryption
                    methods used most commonly is SSL or Secure Sockets Layer, which operates using verification certificates, meaning that if the website has a trusted certificate, it will then begin an encrypted session which is identifiable by
                    the <code>‘https://‘</code> rather than <code>‘http://'</code>. SSL, however, has now been replaced by a more secure and up-to-date protocol called Transport Layer Security or TLS that implements more secure algorithms, using public key authentication and
                    a message authentication code to ensure that no data is lost. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">Some companies or even schools tend to make use of Intranet or Extranet as opposed to the internet. The reason for this is that it is more secure and can also control who has access to certain resources. The
                    internet is basically a global network that allows anyone at any place to access resources or websites without being on a particular network. Intranet on the other hand, is whats used for local networks to share and communicate
                    only with those sharing the same network connection allowing for more secure and controlled resource sharing. Extranet is similar to Intranet in the sense that it controls who views particular data, but this time is not limited
                    by a particular network but controlled by a login/authentication, giving extra control over the levels of access.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">The use of the web has become a major part of the majority of businesses today, benefiting in many different ways and ultimately allowing for rapid business growth. The main benefit to using the web is the large
                    potential customer base with over 3.5 billion internet users worldwide, meaning that even advertising online rather than locally will see a much higher success rate. Not only for the benefit of customers and advertising, it aids
                    with business operation and finance as different companies will be able to communicate or have video conferences, reducing downtime and costs. Even for handling a businesses financial situation can be done online, with web some
                    web systems even monitoring and calculating different figures that would otherwise have to be done manually. As mentioned before, the use of Intranets and private networks can greatly aid a businesses control of resources and
                    access, giving additional security and allowing employers to strive toward a more paperless approach. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">When it comes to web browsing, different browsers have their own strengths and weaknesses, along with diffferent levels of functionality. The first widely known and used web browser that was introduced to windows
                    was Internet Explorer owned by Microsoft, which comes preloaded onto Windows 8. It is widely used throughout the world and is known for being easy to use, especially for those people who are not very computer literate, but is
                    also known for some problems. IE’s main issues are that of speed and security, as it is a main target for malicious hackers due to the lack of responsiveness to bugs or any issues with the browser, also resulting in the speed
                    of the browser. Safari, the web browser produced by Apple, is supported in Mac OX and windows, but reeks benefits as opposed to IE, as it is well known for its fast page-load times and has all security features built in, giving
                    overall better browsing experience with better usability. However, Safari does lack in aesthetic and operating customisation as opposed to other browsers, as there is very little to no aesthetic customisation. This is where
                    browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox gain the advantage as they both have highly customisable browsers, and both with very high operating speeds. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">The CAPTCHA program is designed to check if a user is a bot or human by generating unique tests that only humans will be able to pass. In most cases, the tests provided will show some distorted text and ask you
                    to type in what the text reads. This program has aided in preventing many counterfeit users, e.g. it would help protect against any online polling or website sign ups. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">With the introduction of anonymous or private browsing, there has been a decline in the number of related viruses, as it allows a user to browse the internet without any personal information or browsing history
                    to be stored on the computer, giving that sense of privacy that many don’t feel when using the internet. Not only does it not store any information, but it blocks any websites from reading any of your existing identifiable
                    information. In most web browsers, accessing anonymous browsing is relatively easy, in that it will usually be in the menu or there will be an incognito symbol to click on.</p>

                <p><i>Thursday 10th November 2016</i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">The first commercial markup language introduced into the world of IT was the Standard Generalised Markup Language or SGML, released by NISO in 1985 which was widely used by publishers and government. This became
                    the baseline in the other, more known markup languages we use today. HTML, or HyperText Transfer Protocol was the first to derive from SGML which was created by Tim Berners-Lee in the late 1990s, implementing the well known
                    HTML tags that allowed us to create basic formatting such as bold, italic or creating headers from H1-H5. XML was then released from HTML 1, creating a way to structure data using the tag layout. However, the first official
                    pecification release was HTML 2.0, then followed on by 3 and 4.0. After the release of HTML 4.01 came along XHTML 1.0 (eXtensible), which was a more strict version of the language meaning that web developers had to follow more
                    sets of rules, eg. no self closing tags or mix between upper and lower case tags. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">The Document Object Model, or DOM is an API designed for HTML and XML, and can be referenced using Javascript. It refers to the structure of the HTML and the way it is laid out on the page but also allows web
                    developers to add, edit or delete HTML elements, events or even CSS styles through Javascript without having to reload the page, for example, <code>document.getElementById(“header”).innerHTML = “Hello world!”;</code> is a use
                    of DOM that will change the content of the element with <code>id=“header”</code> to <code>“Hello world!"</code>.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">W3 standards is a set of guidelines for developers that provide better consistency amongst web pages , providing easier navigation, aesthetic changes (CSS), Javascript, PHP and many other standards to aid the
                    web developers and the users. For example, for websites that wish to appear on search engine results will use validation, making it easier for search-engine spidering. For developers who are styling a website, using the W3
                    guidelines will make changes easier, such as colour schemes or borders. To validate any code, the online validator can be used simply by copy-and-paste or uploading the code to the site, then any errors will detected. To
                    verify compliance with Government and Industry Accessibility Standards, an online validator can be used.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">In most IT based companies, there will be a set of guidelines/standards administered by the employer for any programs or websites being designed. For webpages, following employer standards will give the company
                    as a whole better consistency and control. For example they may use a particular framework or certain layout aspects that they wish to keep the same, giving better control over quality and usability. Other standards may also
                    include programming practice, such as using camelCase or other naming conventions, proper use of commenting, indentation or properties (e.g. declaring visibility). </p>
                <p class="logEdit">XML (eXtensible Markup Language) was designed as a data structure to store and transport data, and used quite widely. As a language on its own, XML doesn’t really do anything as its main function is to focus on
                    what data looks like, with HTML designed on how data looks. It uses a similar tag structure to HTML except there are no predefined tags, but tags that the user will define themselves. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">Web applications are now becoming more widely used, in that the browser is used as an application delivery platform in the same way a normal application will work. For any front-end aspects such as links, forms,
                    menu’s etc. can be re-created using html and styled using css, and for any back-end functionality such as linking up to a database or any functions can be written using php, javascript and other tools to successfully create a
                    fully functioning web application.</p>

                <p class="logEdit">With new emerging technologies being released more and more rapidly in todays world, it is essential that the education in the IT industry is kept up-to-date. Technology has significantly impacted the way we
                    live our day-to-day lives and the way we work, and by the looks of things, will continue to take over different aspects of our lives. As it is growing at such a fast rate, it does contradict the traditional teaching methods
                    used and would suggest a possible change in the way education is managed. Many employers in the IT sector will now look at any applicants to jobs with over 4/5 years inactive after a degree, as almost obsolete as programming
                    and developent changes at such a fast rate. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">The IT sector offers a wide range of jobs suited for different areas of expertise. Some jobs that can be found include:</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li><i>Website Analyst</i> - they will have to identify and analyse any incurred costs in developing and maintaining a website, make decisions on purchasing new technologies and researching latest software to aid the web developers
                        in creating the most up-to-date websites. Being successful in this job would entail having fast and thorough research skills and the ability to identify necessary, but not excessive costs. </li>
                    <li><i>Website Manager</i> - this job’s duties would be relative to that of the company, as different companies will provide different duties. In general website managers will be expected to make sure that the website is fully functional,
                        assess and evaluate the websites performance, update the content and to successfully delegate appropriate tasks to each subordinate. A degree in business management and most likely managerial experience would be required
                        for this job.</li>
                    <li><i>Database Administrator</i> - a DBA will be responsible for the performance, security and integrity of a database ensuring that it is fully functioning through all aspects, such as the consistency of data, implementing access
                        and recovery protocols and continuously updating the database to maintain efficient performance. A proficient knowledge in databases, servers and mySQL would be needed for this job.</li>
                    <li><i>Server Administrator</i> - they will be responsible for ensuring that computer networks run efficiently by performing software updates, maintaining computer hardware, tracking server activity and be on call for any other
                        employees who have technical problems.</li>
                    <li><i>Help desk Technician</i> - the help desk technicians will be responsible for providing support for employees and contractors with a high level of customer service and knowledge of a variety of operating systems. Some technicians may
                        also be required to set up and support audio and video conference equipment.</li>
                    <li><i>Web Marketing Manager</i> - a Web Marketing manager will be responsible for designing and performing online marketing strategies by reading and undertaking appropriate market research to increase the companies sales and customer base.
                        This will include media, social networking, and search engine optimisation to create new potential customers. </li>
                    <li><i>Mobile Web Application Developer</i> - this job will entail writing and developing software designed for small resolution screens and wireless devices, such as smartphones or tablets. This will require some different skills as mobile
                        devices contain different technologies from your traditional PC, such as a smartphones accelerometer.</li>
                    <li><i>PC and Mobile Repair Technician</i> - these technicians will repair and maintain computers and mobile devices. Many repair technicians will work for a company exclusively on a set salary, but some work for piece-rate pay, i.e. a customer
                        will pay them a set price to fix their device. To do this job, good analytical, IT and troubleshooting skills will be required. </li>
                  </ol>
                <p class="logEdit">A Web Architect and a web application developer may seem to be similar in job role, but have very different skill sets. A web architect is the person who will look at the ‘big picture’, looking at the overall goal for the web
                    system and planning each part of the system so that it will operate when put together. Their skillset will lie more on the planning and operating of the system but they may not have the knowledge to program each part themselves. This is where
                    the web application developer will come in, to then take the requirements and design the most efficient and effective way to complete the task. For a large system, there will most likely be a team of developers to write the code for each part,
                    which would be assigned by the web architect. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">When it comes to security of a project, there will be a security analyst/consultant and a security manager, each contributing particular tasks. A security manager will be in charge of making sure daily tasks such as monitoring,
                    updating and maintaining the systems are carried out, along with reporting back to the superiors any problems or changes needed. The security analyst/consultant will be involved in the actual assessing of any plans, upgrades or security, and
                    will report back to the security manager.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">When talking about the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of a company, what that means is the leader of the company who is in charge of the business’ goals, mission and the overall decision making. CEO’s will generally have a board
                    of directors who will report back or recommend to them what needs done, then they have the final say on any decisions. However, large companies will sometimes have a Chief Operations Officer (COO) that will take care of all the daily functions
                    and general operating of the company that the CEO will not have the time to do. The COO will report back to the CEO, helping them with any decision making or advising them on certain changes that could aid the businesses operation.</p>

                <p><i>Monday 14th November 2016</i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">Any image that exists on the web will have a particular graphic file format, each with different properties and benefits. The main types of image formats include:</p>
                <ol type="i" class="logEdit">
                    <li>JPEG - this is the most popular file format which uses lossy compression to compress it to a small file, but will result in lower quality images;</li>
                    <li>GIF - popularly recognised as a ‘moving image’ which uses lossless compression that supports animation and transparency, but has a limited colour palette of 24-bit colours;</li>
                    <li>PNG - this file type uses lossless compression and comes in 2 formats: PNG-8 that will have a limited colour range and PNG-24 which will have a higher colour range;</li>
                    <li>TIF - this will be the highest quality format out of the others, using a 48-bit colour palette with lossless compression.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="logEdit">Images not only take file formats, but will also use either raster or vector graphics. Raster graphics is when the image is made up of pixels so if the image is enlarged, you will begin to see the small pixel squares that form
                    the image. The obvious downfall to this type of image is that it can result in low quality images if it is resized. Vectors on the other hand use coordinates and lines to map the image, meaning if it is resized it will still maintain the quality.
                    Vectors also provide a transparent background around the image so if its inserted into a website, it will take the background colour scheme around the gaps whereas a raster image will usually have a white box surrounding it. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">For creating images, there are a number of programmes or packages available that will provide a number of GUI tools and various settings to improve the ‘creative’ experience. There are a number of graphical creation packages
                    available, from simple editors to more complex programs, e.g. Adobe Photoshop being the most popular and well known editor. The first step in creating a new image in the likes of photoshop is to select file>new image where you will be prompted to
                    select the image type and size in pixels. This will then create a blank canvass on the screen where you can begin adding/editing elements from another image, or other created images. Once the desired elements have been inserted, there are a number
                    of different editing tools to customise the image to refined detail, allowing for high levels of creativity. Once the image is complete, it can then be saved and used.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">As we are descending into a more technological age, many sectors and businesses have been affected, and in some cases, making traditional approaches obsolete. Photography is one that is also becoming affected due to the capability
                    of editing and modifying images on graphical software. However, some still prefer the traditional approach of stock phototography, i.e. having a photographer take a quantity of images and choosing the most suitable. Using traditional photography
                    has its benefits, such as the large selection of images that can be chosen from, the unedited authenticity of the images and ultimately saving time and money for businesses. However, using stock photography would not be preferable for
                    people/businesses that are looking for specific photos for a project as they are designed to appeal to a wide audience.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">When using any colours on a website, it is always useful to check it over with the browser-safe colour palette, which is a palette of 216 colours that are recognised by both Mac and Windows operating systems, with each OS having
                    40 reserved colours making a total of 256 colours that can be used. If one of the 40 reserved colours are chosen, the opposing system will use a combination of the other 216 colours to get a close match. The use of colours on a website is more
                    important than people realise, as the colour can have an effect on the mood, symbolism of culture, readability and consistency. Particular colours are seen to represent different moods, for example, blue is seen to be quite refreshing or cool
                    giving the user a more peaceful mood whereas red is seen as quite an empowerment colour portraying passion. However, the use of colour schemes is becoming more and more difficult for developers as different cultures will see colours to mean
                    different things, for example, black in the US is associated with death and evil whereas in China it is associated with happiness, and yellow is seen as a sacred/imperial colour in Asian countries whereas it isn’t associated with much in other
                    countries. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">CSS or Cascading Style Sheet is a relatively new innovation in how we style an HTML document. Generally, it will be in a separate css file linked into the HTML document and has quite a simple structure to it. To reference anything
                    from HTML to CSS, use can use id’s, classes or specific tag names, then followed by a curly bracket to tell the sheet that we are beginning the style. CSS can be applied to an HTML document in different ways: Inline which is when the style is written
                    inside the html tag using <code>style=“##”</code>; Embedded, which is when the css is written in the head of the html page inside &ltstyle&gt tags, and Linked which is when the css is contained in a separate file, then linked back to the html page
                    using &ltlink&gt.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Designing websites for mobile devices has its challenges, as it is quite different from designing a website for standard computer resolutions as there is a vast number of mobile devices with different resolutions and specifications.
                    For the best user friendly experience, all display specifications would need to be optimised appropriately to ensure the website has full functionality on all devices. Scrolling can also be a challenge as Android and iOS handle it differently meaning
                    that they will have to be programmed differently. When the website is shrunk down to a smaller resolution, any fixed and fluid sized elements will need to be checked over to see if everything still proportionate and still readable from a phone. </p>

                <p><i>Thursday 17th November 2016</i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">Boolean operators are the symbols we use to connect different search criteria together to either get more refined or broadened results, with the three operators being AND, OR and NOT <code>(&&, ||, !).</code> The AND operator is
                    applied whenever you want to search using all the specified criteria to get more refined results, e.g. in this if statement, <code>if(x<3 && y=true && z>x)</code>, all three conditions will be checked and will only run if all three are true.
                    The OR operator is used when we wish to broaden our results, as it will return if any of the criteria are true, even if the others return false, e.g. in this statement, <code>if(x<3 || y=true || z>x)</code>, the statement will run if any of
                    the three conditions are true. And finally, the NOT operator will tell the computer to do the opposite, i.e. <code>if(pwordCheck != password)</code> will run the if statement if the pwordCheck variable is NOT equal to the password variable.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">In most search engines you can now use boolean operators when searching to give you a more accurate and refined search results. In Google’s search engine, we can use the boolean operators by using the keyword in caps, for
                    example, search1 AND search2 will search for both words on either side of the operator. This works for the other OR and NOT operators, simply by typing in the word in-between the searches. For any websites out there that wish to be found
                    where searched for, using keywords is the connector that give the websites search engine optimisation (SEO), linking any content or pages so that if someone has searched for it, the website will be shown. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">Search sites, or search engines, are websites designed to search and aggregate a range of websites based upon the users search criteria. Search engines such as Google is used over 40,000 times a second, which accumulates
                    to over 3.5 billion searches per day. An Information portal however, provides a single gateway to many different sources of information and media, most commonly used by businesses or students. A web page is then based upon a certain
                    business or topic to either provide information or perform a service, e.g. youtube.com for streaming videos. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">Meta search engines are what we use to essentially collate results from all the top results from all search engines, then apply their own algorithms to the results. A meta search engine will search the entered string and
                    search it into different engines to then compile a series of results from each. This uses whats called a virtual database by running a query on the other engine databases giving the opportunity to find a mixture of popular and obscure
                    websites. To enhance the accuracy and overall performance of search engines, they release spiders or web crawlers to browse the World Wide Web creating a search engine index. Spiders will take it upon themselves to index every word on
                    the page and following every link to ensure that everything is accounted for by taking note of two things in the html: the words within the page and where the words are found. Spiders are very fast travelling, with some able to crawl over
                    25 pages per second and generate over 150 kbp/s of data, meaning that if a company were to release a large amount of spiders, they could respectively search a large portion of websites to give more accurate search engine results. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">Researching into different articles or papers can be a tedious task in that there are thousands available for most subjects. However, some papers may not be completely accurate or can vary from the truth which is why
                    you’ll find papers that are peer-reviewed. There are two different types of peer review: authoritative and open. Authoritative peer review refers to papers that are reviewed by a small group of authors or researchers that will generally
                    be experts in that particular field, but the feedback will be completely anonymous, whereas open peer reviews use a more open group of people, who many not be experts in the field, but would have adequate knowledge to provide some
                    feedback relating to the paper. Open peer reviews are also not anonymous, meaning that the author can see who reviewed the paper. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">Gathering research online can be tricky to get relevant or accurate sources which is why different forms of research can be carried out to ensure accurate and relevant research is gathered. Primary  resources are obtained
                    “brand-new” in that the information is gathered specific to what is needed directly from primary research, which could include surveys, direct feedback or focus groups. This can be a costly approach to market research as it requires planning,
                    setting up and can be time consuming. For many businesses this may not be an efficient approach, especially if some of the research has been carried out before. This is where secondary resources comes into play as it is resources or research
                    that has been carried out before, such as analysis reports, critique or other market research. This approach is much more cost and time effective but will deprive in the accuracy and meticulousness that primary resources will provide. And
                    finally, indexes or tertiary resources is essentially an address book for primary and secondary resources.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Cookies are now a common sight in most websites, reading and storing information about specific users to personalise your overall web experience. Here are some of the advantages of using cookies: they are easy to implement
                    into a website; it will give the user a more personalised web experience; allows businesses to easily view different stats to alter marketing techniques. Some disadvantages include: they are not secure as the information is stored in plain
                    text; the user may not want the information stored and most cases, not realise its happening; each cookie has a size limit of 4kb with a maximum of 20 cookies per site.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Caching is the process of storing data in a temporary storage area (cache) usually on your hard disk to provide more efficient web browsing. For example, when browsing a web page and you click on a link or request any files,
                    it will save these into a cache so when you return to the page the browser will get the files locally rather than the original server, ultimately saving time and relieving the network of extra traffic.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Scheduling software programs can aid the operation of businesses or any IT projects at hand. The main way it will benefit is that there will be a clear, concise set of instructions, each with set time limits to ensure that
                    the project is completed on time, with no elements missing. As well as time management software, there are various Personal Information Management (PIM) applications that aid in keeping track of emails, schedules etc. such as Microsoft
                    Outlook, OneNote, Google calendar, iOS calendar or iOS contacts. Peer-to-peer services or P2P create a direct link between users without any intermediary servers.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Networks are the base of every connection we make to communicate between devices, ranging from small local networks to much larger, wider networks. As every connection is made through them, it is vital that the data is
                    encrypted as any un-encrypted data can be very easily compromised, especially if there are malicious attacks against the network. Using text messaging or SMS (Short Message Service) for communicating and sending information has its benefits
                    and drawbacks. Benefits include: messages can be sent 24/7; much more time efficient than a phone call; the receiving device does not need to be turned on; can be sent to any device, i.e. multi-platform. However, some drawbacks include:
                    only suitable for informal messages; messages have a character limit; nimble fingers would be needed as mobile device keypads can be small. Many companies will use mass messaging or email services to advertise or to notify users of any
                    updates as it gives a more personal feel to the message while also ensuring that the user will read it. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">Configuring the proxy settings on the computer will allow the user to run all its communications through a proxy server who’s cache can serve all users. The benefit of proxy servers is the speed of obtaining information
                    as it can be retrieved from cache instead of repeating requests. Client-side caching is basically the same thing except it will be cached locally on the machine.</p>

                <p><i>Monday 28th November 2016</i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME is an email extension that allows the user to send various file formats such as images, audio or video by formatting non-ASCII messages. S/MIME or Secure Multipurpose Internet
                    Mail Extensions is the standard for encrypting and signing emails that are sent to ensure that the person receiving the email is certain that the message is genuine and not a counterfeit user. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is software owned
                    by PGP inc. that uses various encryption methods, such as data compression, hashing, public and symmetric key to secure any data being transferred or communicated, usually used for text files, emails, directories and disk partitions.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">An email signature is a section of text that appears at the bottom of any email that is sent, usually containing personal information such as name, contact information, business information or any links. Using this in a
                    business situation is always useful as it provides an easy way for someone to contact you back without looking up the information manually. Another useful feature now used widely in emails is the conversation threads which systematically
                    groups any messages being sent back and fourth from recipients. This proves useful to people who would send and receive numerous emails daily as it would become difficult to keep track of every conversation or remember what the topic of
                    discussion is about. Using this feature can prove useful to many, but most of all to people who have high email traffic or to those who have a busy schedule and don’t have time to be looking back on previous emails. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">BCC or Blind Carbon Copy is an email feature that allows the sender to send an email to someone with the identity protected from the other primary and secondary recipients (To and CC). In any email client, there will be
                    a forward and a reply option, usually with quite similar buttons, but perform two different tasks. If a user forwards an email, it essentially sends a copy of the received email to a different recipient whereas replying is simply sending
                    an email back to the person who sent the original message. Emails are commonly used in the workplace to communicate to multiple users, transfer files or information, arranging meetings or communicating between customers or other businesses.
                    The content of the email should always be concise, with a clear logical order and a direct subject line to capture the attention of the recipient. Any emails being sent in the workplace should always have a professional tone with proper
                    use of grammar and punctuation, then followed by a closing signature at the bottom, usually ending with “regards” or “yours sincerely” along with the users name. However, using emails are targets for spreading viruses or subject to
                    phishing as many businesses will transfer useful or sensitive information. Viruses can be spread simply by opening a link or attachment which will be sent by a hoax user. A release of a virus in a local business network could be
                    catastrophic as it could compromise valuable company information or even shut down the internal network altogether. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">Using email as a form of communication throughout a business has its benefits over other forms of communication, such as texting when in certain situations. Sending emails to a number of recipients is almost immediate,
                    cutting on downtime while improving response times. Using texting as a form of communication can be quite costly due to geographical influences, in that texting to someone in another country can incur network charges whereas email is
                    completely free to send and receive messages. However, people are much more likely to open, read or reply to a text than an email with an average of 95% of texts being read in under 3 minutes. The main reason for this is due to the
                    high amount of spam emails that are sent which in turn, makes people less conscious of emails. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">There are security concerns that can arise from web-based and IMAP-based emails. Using web-based email has one major flaw; malicious hackers in that if someone was targeted and accessed, they could access their email from
                    the browser or intercept it mid-communication. Using IMAP as an alternative also has its drawbacks, as the client that the mail is hosted on will download the emails automatically, meaning that if any email contains harmful
                    malware/viruses, they could infect your computer or obtain unwanted personal details.</p>

                <p><i>Wednesday 30th November 2016</i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">Project management is defined as the process of planning, instigating, controlling and completing a given project on time within budget and scope.  Effective project management will aim to get the best out of all employees
                    to ensure that the project is completed efficiently, and that it follows specification, security, legislation and regulation. The project management triangle is a model used by managers to analyse and understand any difficulties that
                    would emerge. The triangle has three constraints: time, cost and scope where is one constraint is affected, the others will be directly affected, for example, if the scope needs to be reduced, costs will reduce and time will increase.
                    When undertaking a project with a client, a needs analysis will be taken to identify the user needs, whether it be by interview, data analysis or even market research to get a clear picture of the current position of the client. When
                    using the term ‘scope’ in project management, it refers to the requirements that are projected to be completed with the workforce and timescale. Any requirements that are deemed out of scope can be requests made by the client that are not
                    included in the requirements, or if there is already too much workload for the given amount of time. Any other requirements that were completed during the scope but were not listed are defined as project creep. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">A cross-functional team is a team with each person carrying a different skill set or expertise, but working together to achieve the same goal. This can be very useful in an IT based project as most people will specialise
                    in specific areas, for example, if a client needed a fully functioning e-commerce website, the cross-functional team could include a web designer for the front-end with as team of developers that would specialise in making the website
                    fully operational. The separation of duties within a project is key, as I stated before, everyone will have a certain area of expertise and if duties are properly separated and managed, successfully completing the project to the highest
                    quality would be imminent.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">An information flow is a model that visually displays each stage of where the information is passed from start to finish. This provides a clear understanding of any communication links, restrictions or any intermediaries
                    to ensure that the information is passed as efficiently as possible. Depending on the situation, it could flow horizontally, e.g. going through an online checkout, or flow vertically i.e. if its flowing from management down to subordinates.
                    The IT department in a business should be able to report any work to upper management, but with a level of clarity to ensure the information can be easily read and interpreted, ultimately aiding them in making any managerial decisions. The
                    most common way this is done in larger businesses is through physical reports over a time period, or in the case of smaller businesses it would be as simple as informal discussion or via email.  </p>
                <p class="logEdit">A statement of work is provided before the actual designing of a project. It gives a clear-cut record of what they plan to achieve and complete in the project to ensure that there is no mis-communication between the customer
                    and business. It also helps the customer fully understand what is going into the project and to what time scale it should be completed. When creating a project to certain requirements, it is important to take into account the social and
                    practical implications of the end user and to make it user-friendly to cater all types of users. For example, if a developer was building a web system and suddenly decided to incorporate an icon-based menu, some non-technical users will
                    find it difficult to use. ROI or Return on Investment is used to compare the profitability of an investment to make a decision if it is financially viable to invest. For example, if a business invests £25,000 into a new server where it
                    will increase customers and churns out a net profit of £10,000 for the month, the ROI is 40%.  </p>
                <p class="logEdit">Documenting the progress of a project is crucial in managing any arisen problems, workflow, making sure that everything is on-time and provides documented proof that certain activities were completed. Quality management
                    is essential for ensuring the product/service is of high quality so the customer is satisfied. If the business also provides quality assurance, it gives the customer a sense of comfort that the end product will be high quality, and in
                    the unlikely case that it isn’t, the business is liable as they provided the customer with assurance. Performing risk assessments throughout a project can prove useful in case any of the risks occur. Evaluating the possible risks means
                    that precautions or resolutions can be worked out, and if the situation is beyond control, it should be escalated to higher management for further resolution.</p>

                <p><i>Monday 5th December 2016</i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">Legal issues that surround websites are:</p>
                <ol type="i" class="logEdit">
                    <li><i>Copyright</i> - Using any content found online should always be checked for copyright as any content used with copyright could then face legal issues of copyright infringement. Most cases, however, it is a simple reference
                        or contacting the owner for permission.</li>
                    <li><i>Information Security</i> - If the website holds any sensitive or private information about people, it should be properly protected/encrypted by law (Data Protection Act 1998).</li>
                    <li><i>Defamation</i> - If any content on the website is referencing or ‘slandering’ about someone without facts can face legal action for the Defamation Act 2013. </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="logEdit">Getting feedback from customers can be one of the most useful ways to develop or change parts of a website as it gives a first hand opinion from the user on what should be changed. Ways to obtain feedback include one-on-one
                    interviews, a feedback form (online or paper form), surveys, social listening, usage and error statistics or even informal discussions. When initially coming up with a plan or concept that could potentially be worth something or could be
                    damaging for competitors to get access to, a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) would be signed to ensure that an parties involved are sworn by law to not share any content with any third parties. If content were to leak out, the person held
                    accountable could face legal action. Many companies will have a legal team to be consulted if any legal documents are being signed, if the company is facing any legal action or if they’ve received a notice or if there are any concerns
                    with employees relating to their wellbeing or pay.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">When developing a website, there are ethical issues that could be faced that won’t necessarily be illegal. The biggest ethical issue to come with websites is user manipulation though UX design as it can tempt people into
                    doing something they will later regret. Other ethical issues that could be faced include: web accessibility in that the website should provide visual and audio alternative for the disabled; encouraging criminal behaviour; buying or
                    obtaining domain names without the intention of using them (cyber-squatting); refrain from releasing mass amounts of spam. </p>

                <p><i>Tuesday 6th December 2016</i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">Client side programming refers to the entire program that will run on the client to generally improve the user interface or different stylings. The most used web browser client-side language used is Javascript which now has
                    different frameworks such as jQuery designed to create shortcuts in coding, ultimately making it faster and easier to develop. Other client-side languages include CSS for styling web pages or AJAX (not technically a language) to request
                    and display data from a server. Common Gateway Interface or CGI is a way of requesting and sending data from the user to a server using GET and POST methods. The GET method is used for sending a request to a web server, e.g. requesting a
                    web page, whereas the POST method is used for sending data to a web server, e.g. an online application form submission. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">Database connectivity technologies are used when we want to connect a database to a system or website to then access and display data. SQL or Structured Query Language is the most used form of database connectivity, providing
                    relational database management at ease. Other forms of SQL are available, for example NoSQL (for non-relational database management), Oracle, SQL Server or PostgreSQL. A 2-tier architecture model is when the interface or application is run
                    on the client-side (presentation layer) with any data being stored on a server (data layer). N-tier architecture has at least one intermediary that will perform the commands, decisions and calculations needed to process the data between
                    the data and presentation layer. The main advantages of using n-tier architecture are better data management, easier to maintain, increased security, other layers unaffected by any changes made to middle layer, much easier to expand in size.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Having your own server may seem quite expensive to purchase, but that is only a small portion of the cost. The main costs of owning and running your own server include the cost of hardware, cost of server operating system &
                    applications, administration costs and setup costs. In total this can add up to become very costly so any decision made on placing a server should be properly monetarily evaluated. Using a cloud service provider will also incur costs such
                    as service costs, i.e. the cloud company rates for using their services, broadband costs which can be high to serve a server is needed or setup costs. Dedicated hosting is when the person/business leases a server from a third-party company,
                    usually kept in a data centre. Co-location hosting is where the person can rent space for the server, but also provide power, cooling, bandwidth and security. A virtual server is a virtual machine hosted on a third party server.</p>

                <p><i>Wednesday 7th December 2016</i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">Server-based networks consist of a central server with multiple devices/PC’s connected, allowing users to access any shared resources whereas peer-to-peer networks consist of all the computers being connected to each other
                    with no central location. The main benefit of using peer-to-peer is the speed of sharing and uploading files is increased, but server-based networks benefit in backing up critical information as it is all stored in the one area. There are
                    two main types of networks: Local Area Networks (LAN) and Wide Area Networks (WAN). LAN’s are used for local businesses/groups, usually confined to a single building or geographical area, which provide a local network for everyone within
                    to login, share and read resources, whereas WAN’s cover a large geographical area. The main advantage of LAN’s is that there it is much faster and more secure than WAN’s, as well as being much less problematic. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">The OSI reference model is a visual representation of how applications communicate which consists of 7 layers: </p>
                <ol type="i" class="logEdit">
                    <li>Layer 1: Physical - This layer refers to the electrical and mechanical components needed to send the bit stream, e.g. cables, cards etc.;</li>
                    <li>Layer 2: Data Link - This is where the data packets are encoded and decoded with the transmission protocol;</li>
                    <li>Layer 3: Network - This provides the switching and routing technologies for the data to be transmitted, making sure that all incoming/outgoing transmissions go to the correct destination;</li>
                    <li>Layer 4: Transport - This is where the data is packeted and managing the delivery of the packets. TCP and UDP is used in this layer;</li>
                    <li>Layer 5: Session - This layer will start, manage and end any connections, conversations, exchanges our dialogues between applications;</li>
                    <li>Layer 6: Presentation - This layer will be on the clients OS which will read and convert incoming and outgoing data from an encrypted format to a readable format, i.e. to present it to the end user;</li>
                    <li>Layer 7: Application - The final layer which identifies communication partners, authenticates users & privacy and assess the network capacity. </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="logEdit">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the process of breaking up information that has been sent into smaller pieces, called data packets. These packets are then sent and put back together in the correct order. Internet Protocol
                    (IP) is linked with TCP as it is the final stage in taking the data packets and directing them to the required destination, using an IP address which will be unique to every computer. Network topologies refer to the schematic layout of a network,
                    and how/where each node is connected. The most basic topology is BUS, which is where every computer is connected to one single cable with only two endpoints, which can be useful in small networks. The STAR, a more common topology, is where each
                    computer/node is connected to a central hub with each node having their own dedicated connection. A TREE topology is a more hierarchical form, where there will be different layers or groups connecting to each other. These are usually found in WAN’s.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Internet Infrastructure is a term that describes the hardware and software that communicates information between various networks/systems. The internet infrastructure will be located in data centres that will house all the
                    components and devices needed to provide a connection to the internet. Servers are the most vital component to the infrastructure which store, process and connect data from all over the world. Large servers are usually kept in the data centres
                    where they can be cooled and secured. The next component is a storage device where the user will store the necessary data to be viewed. The final component is software that will allow us to interact and use the stored data. There are two different
                    types of IP address: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is the most commonly known IP which comes in the form of 123.456.789.xxx, with x usually ranging from 1 to 255 depending on how many devices are allowed on the network. The problem with this IP is the
                    forever growing number of electronic devices that all require an address, the number of addresses will eventually run out. This is where the new IPv6 comes in which is aimed to replace the older current version. This form of IP will provide more
                    efficient routing, easier administration and provides more flexible extensions. A typical IPv6 address would take this form: 3ff3:1900:4545:3:200:f8ff:fe21:67cf. </p>
                <p class="logEdit">When connecting a network together, there are different types of network cables available for different types of network’s topologies, protocol and size. Twisted pair cabling comes in two types: unshielded and shielded. Unshielded
                    is the most popular type as it can range from a telephone speed cable to more high speed cables running at 10 Gbit/s while being the cheapest cable. Shielded Twisted pair (STP) is slightly more expensive but will benefit against UTP as it is
                    shielded with foil to avoid against any electrical or radio interference. As of recently, a newer cable has been released; fibre optic cables which use a completely different method of transmitting data. Instead of using electronic signals,
                    fibre optic uses light signals with a glass core meaning it can transmit over much longer distances and at a much higher speed. The fastest fibre optic cable that can be commercially bought is around 100Gbps.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to every electronic device in the format of 4 sets of 3-digit numbers (IPv4). Static routing is when the administrator will manually or statically program all routes in the routing
                    table whereas dynamic routing is when the routing tables are maintained automatically. Interior routing protocols are used inside a local network that handle all routing automatically whereas exterior routing protocols are used for when you
                    want to access something outside of the network, i.e. on the internet. TCP/IP network parameters include the host name, IP address, Subnet mask, DHCP Client and router. Public IP addresses are those assigned by your ISP whereas a private IP
                    address is assigned in a private network where the owner of the network will assign them manually.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">A data network is commonly made up of a central hub with connecting nodes to communicate and transmit data (can be different layouts or topologies) through data switching and transmission lines whereas a telephony network will
                    contain a telephone linked to a modem, which will connect to PSTN, which is a collection of all public telephone networks. Distributed Architecture is the term used to describe the structure of distributed systems, describing all links/components
                    and how they’re connected. Distributed computing is the actual system of computers and how they are networked together to communicate with each other. A Network Operations Center (NOC) is the process of having a computer(s) that will take all
                    incoming and outgoing traffic and monitor traffic and performance data, update software and remotely secure the entire network. The difference between hardware and software connection devices is that hardware, e.g. a server will be physically
                    linked to the network whereas a software connection device is virtual, i.e. like a virtual server or machine, which could go by the hundreds in a single server. Any incoming traffic will go to the physical server, but the software connection
                    devices will direct the data ti where it needs to go.</p>

                <p><i>Friday 9th December 2016</i></p>
                <p class="logEdit">Phishing is the act of pretending to be an authentic business/person to then valuable user information, such as usernames and passwords. This is usually in the form of email attachents or website links. Pharming is the act of
                    directing users to a fake website that looks almost identical to the legitimate one by installing malicious code on a users computer that will direct them to the fake site without knowledge. Pharming is similar to phishing, except the user
                    doesn’t need to be baited. Most wifi networks will run in whats called infrastructure mode which is when the computers will communicate through an access point, i.e the data packets will be sent to the access point, then back to the receiving
                    computer rather than directly. However Ad-hoc mode is communicating directly with each device without an access point.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">Setting up a wireless LAN within a company has large benefits over a wired network, such as the increased ability to expand the network faster and with lower costs, better access to different areas in the network that would
                    be hard to reach in a wired network or the fact that employees can roam the building without losing their connection. However, using wireless LAN’s over wired will bring higher security threats as well as slower connection speeds. The main
                    drawback to switching to wireless LAN’s is the high setup costs as well as a need for new equipment. A wireless access point is a hardware device similar to a router in that it allows devices to connect to the network wirelessly with the
                    access point wired through ethernet. The difference between that and a router is that router has built in firewall options.</p>
                <p class="logEdit">MAC address filtering allows you to create a list of devices that are allowed access to your wifi network, creating a visual list of who’s granted and who’s denied access. In the last 6 years, 4G networks were introduced
                    with the main benefit of providing a faster data transfer rate, aiming at a potential rate of 100M/bps. They also bring much more coverage than Wifi and will encounter overlapping network ranges, meaning that connectivity is guaranteed to
                    many users. Using mobile hotspots as a form of connectivity, in essence gives you wifi on-the-go. Mobile hotspots will usually allow for up to 10 devices. Mobile devices allow us to connect to anything remotely through the use of wifi or 3G,
                    but in recent years there has been the release of the cloud, which allows us to upload, view, change or delete files onto a cloud-based server. The main benefit of this is that the data is protected in that if the mobile device got lost,
                    stolen or damaged, all the data will still be there on the users cloud account. However, using the cloud has its drawbacks, with the main one being downtime in that it is entirely dependent on an internet connection, meaning that if there
                    any issues with the connection, no files can be accessed. Cloud computing also introduces new security threats as malicious attackers will target the servers and if they gain access, they can misuse or delete all the data.</p>

                <ol type="i" class="logEdit">
                    <li>Provides security for wireless local area networks (WLAN) using either 64 bit or 128 bit encryption;</li>
                    <li>Gives the same level of security as a wired LAN</li>
                    <li>Can be used for mobile devices such as phones, mp3’s etc.</li>
                </ol>
